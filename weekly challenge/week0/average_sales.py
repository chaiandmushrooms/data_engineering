# Combine what youâ€™ve learned:
#     - Create a `.csv` with dummy sales data
#     - Write a Python script to read it, clean it, and output total 
#       sales per customer
# Push the `.csv`, the script, and the output file to GitHub

# given that the data I'm choosing to use doesn't have a customer ID
# as an unique identifier, I'm going to assume every customer name from
# the same postal code is one individual
