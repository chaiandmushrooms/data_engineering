### My Data Engineering Journey

Hey there! This repo is my personal roadmap and log as I transition into a career in **Data Engineering**. I'm building this from the ground up, coming from a non-tech background — so everything here is raw, real, and part of the grind.

---

### Why I'm Doing This

I've worked in the diving industry, but I'm pivoting into tech — specifically **Cloud**, **Business Intelligence**, and **Data Engineering**. This repo helps me:

- Stay consistent and accountable
- Document what I’m learning
- Track progress toward landing a job

---

### Daily Routine

I study **8+ hours a day** and follow a structured plan. Every day I:

- Practice Python, SQL and Git
- Tackle data engineering problems
- Log progress in this repo

---

### Tools I'm Using

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Cloud**: AWS
- **Data Tools**: Pandas, PostgreSQL, Airflow (coming soon)
- **Learning Platforms**: CS50, YouTube, Books, Open Source Projects
